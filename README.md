# Widget App
It is a website made using React.js where you can find different widgets (clock, notes, weather...).
This app is my first experience after learning React.js and I will be adding more widgets as I learn more about it.

***Available widgets:***

+ **Clock**

  Shows the instant time and date.

+ **Notes**

  A widget where you can take notes. [Database will be added for saving notes.]

+ **Weather**

  Widget showing instant weather. [Under construction.] [Will be done using API.]
