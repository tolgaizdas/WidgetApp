# Widget App

It is a website made using React.js where you can find different widgets.
This app is my first experience after learning React.js and I will be adding more widgets as I learn more about it.

**_Available widgets:_**

- **Clock**

  Shows the instant time and date.

- **Notes**

  A widget where you can take notes. [Database will be added for saving notes.]

- **Weather**

  A widget that displays the current weather (city name, temperature, feels like temperature...) for the searched city. [Used [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api)]

- **Social Media**

  By using this widget you can add outgoing links to your social media accounts. [Favicons added.]
